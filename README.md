## Parenthesis Checker
by Chris Bartek

This is a basic parenthesis checker snippet written in Javascript.

Assignment 4: Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.

I assume the intention isn't to check actual LISP code with brackets, braces, etc. so this function just concentrates on parenthesis per instructions. ES5 used for simplicity's sake.
